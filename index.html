							<div class="reflection-box">
								<p><strong>1. What I have gained:</strong><br>
								"I attended the UTM Open Day held at UTM Digital, which served as my first Industrial Visit. It was a great opportunity where various companies reviewed their latest products and shared how technology is shaping the future. I gained a clear understanding of how UTM Smart services facilitate our campus life and the importance of UTM WiFi for our academic success. Moreover, I was introduced to several AI applications that are currently trending in the industry. Participating in the Q&A session was a highlight for me, as I won a UTM-branded pen for my correct answer, which really boosted my confidence."</p>

							</div>

							<div class="reflection-box">
								<p><strong>2. Suggested Improvements:</strong><br>
								"Since the event was at UTM Digital, it was already very tech-focused. However, I suggest that future Open Days could include a 'Tech-Walk' through the UTM Digital servers or data centers to give students a behind-the-scenes look at the infrastructure. Also, having more booth-based short hackathons or problem-solving tasks would make the industrial interaction even more exciting."</p>
								
								<p><strong>3. Reflection on Opinion, Idea, and Creativity:</strong><br>
								"The environment at UTM Digital during the Open Day was inspiring. My reflection is that such events bridge the gap between students and the corporate world. It sparked an idea in me: what if we had a UTM Smart App feature that uses AI to guide new students during such Open Days with real-time navigation and booth information? This visit encouraged me to be more proactive in learning and to think creatively about how our university’s digital resources can be further enhanced."</p>

							<h4 style="color: #212931;">1.2 Reflection for Poster: PPG Industrial Talk 1</h4>
							
							<img src="poster for industrial talk1(assignment 2).jpeg" alt="PPG Industrial Talk Poster" class="assignment-img">

							<div class="reflection-box">
								<p><strong>1. What I have gained:</strong><br>
								"While creating this poster for the PPG Industrial Talk 1, I dived deep into how a global leader uses data to drive its business. I gained detailed knowledge about Data Analytics COE, specifically how innovations like the Marine Hull Navigator predict risks and save fuel costs. I also learned about PPG's Cloud-Only infrastructure strategy, utilizing AWS and Azure to maintain a global network. Furthermore, exploring the SAP Process Flow (Procure to Pay and Order to Cash) helped me understand how an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) system connects finance, logistics, and operations in real-time."</p>
								<p><strong>2. Suggested Improvements:</strong><br>
								"The session provided a great overview of high-level architecture. However, to improve future learning, I suggest including a comparison study between traditional industrial methods and these new AI-driven models. Additionally, a brief session on the specific cybersecurity protocols used within the Multi-Cloud Ecosystem would provide a more holistic view of the technical safety measures involved."</p>
								<p><strong>3. Reflection on Opinion, Idea, and Creativity:</strong><br>
								"This poster is a result of my effort to translate complex industrial data into a clean, visual narrative. My creative idea was to use infographics to represent the SAP modules and Global Infrastructure so that even a non-technical person could understand the flow. My key reflection is that 'ICT is a strategic business driver, not just technical support.' This assignment has motivated me to bridge the gap between academic coding and real-world industrial mastery, pushing me to think more about user-centric data visualization."</p>

							<p><a href="industrial talk 2 Academic Writing(assignment 3).pdf" target="_blank" class="button icon solid fa-file-pdf">View Academic Writing PDF</a></p>
							<div class="reflection-box">
								<p><strong>1. What I have gained:</strong><br>
								"From this industrial talk, I learned that success in computer science requires far more than just strong programming skills. I gained a clear understanding of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) and the importance of planning, system design, and teamwork in creating scalable solutions. The speaker emphasized that modern development is a collaborative ecosystem where understanding user requirements and project goals is just as critical as writing code."</p>
								<p><strong>2. Suggested Improvements:</strong><br>
								"While the talk provided a great theoretical overview, I suggest that future sessions could include a collaborative mini-sprint workshop."</p>
								<p><strong>3. Reflection on Opinion, Idea, and Creativity:</strong><br>
								"The session encouraged me to develop a balanced skill set that combines technical knowledge with system-level thinking and adaptability."</p>

							<h4 style="color: #212931;">2. Reflection for PC Assemble Report</h4>
							<p><a href="PC Assemble Report.pdf" target="_blank" class="button icon solid fa-file-pdf">View PC Assemble Report PDF</a></p>
							<div class="reflection-box">
								<p><strong>1. What I have gained:</strong><br>
								"The PC assembly project was a hands-on journey into the heart of computer hardware. I gained practical experience in identifying and installing various components such as the motherboard, CPU, RAM, and storage drives. I learned the importance of delicate handling, especially when seated the processor and managing power cables."</p>
								<p><strong>2. Suggested Improvements:</strong><br>
								"While the assembly was successful, I suggest that future sessions could include more in-depth training on Cable Management and airflow optimization within the case."</p>
								<p><strong>3. Reflection on Opinion, Idea, and Creativity:</strong><br>
								"Assembling a PC from scratch felt like solving a complex puzzle where every piece must fit perfectly. My reflection is that this experience removed the 'black box' mystery of how computers work."</p>

							<h4 style="color: #212931;">3. Reflection for Design Thinking (BuddyUp App Prototype)</h4>
							<p><a href="Design thinking (low fidelity prototype).pdf" target="_blank" class="button icon solid fa-file-pdf">View Prototype PDF</a></p>
							<div class="reflection-box">
								<p><strong>1. What I have gained:</strong><br>
								"In this project, I worked with my team to design BuddyUp, a student-to-student support platform. I gained a deep understanding of the 'Design Thinking' process by identifying the gap in academic support for first-year students. I learned how to structure an app with Key Features like a Mentorship System, Resource Hub, and Discussion Forums."</p>
								<p><strong>2. Suggested Improvements:</strong><br>
								"The current prototype focuses heavily on academic support. I suggest adding a 'Peer Counseling' feature where students can discuss mental health anonymously."</p>
								<p><strong>3. Reflection on Opinion, Idea, and Creativity:</strong><br>
								"This project allowed me to be creative in problem-solving. My main reflection is that a simple app can solve a major problem—the 'Academic Gap'."</p>
